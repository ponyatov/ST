Programming language is **homoiconic** when it treats any program written in this language, or generated in runtime, as a first-class data structure which this language can be freely modified using its own operations.

The first sign the language is homoiconic is programs written in it will be parsed into an intermediate representation which is the data structure defined in this language as a data type, and available for modification in runtime (or at compile stage).

Homoiconicity should be treated as a must-have feature for any language designed for the ease of programming, and language power, and extendability. When you are able to generate an arbitrary code programmatically in runtime or before the compiler passes runs, and also can run any code between parser and compiler, your power rises to the Sun.

Homoiconic language interpreter is very ineffective in production use and, saying more, is dangerous to your data and business, but for MVP purposes, software prototyping, tooling, and experimental works it is unbitten and uncomparable flexible.
