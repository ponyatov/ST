# Smalltalk

Smalltalk is a vintage programming language that was developed at the end of the 70th Xerox Alto by the Alan Kay team. Smalltalk was ahead of his time, as it was the full and true OOP language, but due to large prices of commercial versions and hardware limitations, the Smalltalk language was drop out of usage.

Nowadays its ideas can still kickass any modern interpreter-based languages such as JavaScript and Python, and even Java, but it is mostly unknown, and its design and syntax is a bit [[drawbacks|problematic]].
