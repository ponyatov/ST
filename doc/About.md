This is a [[ST/Smalltalk|Smalltalk]]-ish system based on a portable bytecode interpreter that acts like a GuestOS over any generic system (mainstream OS, or can be embedded into any large software system by your selection).

## #Smalltalk is for:

- fast software [[prototyping]] and experiments in systems design
- OS-like interactive system based on programming language engine
- the first language for programming learning
	- interactive and easy to use debugging tools
	- rich user interface
	- concepts and paradigms friendly for ordinary people not for computer science professors and Haskell/Lisp fans

Original Smalltalk has some notable [[drawbacks]] so its design and syntax should be rethought with modern habits, tendencies, and the feel of programming culture.

## [[ST/Implementation|Implementation]]

This Smalltalk-ish language variant is far from its original design.

First of all, the origin ST is significantly overcomplicated, which is not good both for learning, modifications, or porting to new systems. It is not a good idea also to follow old language design decisions which showed itself non-compatible with modern programming habits and limit the system use in integration with already existing infrastructure.

So an unpopular decision was taken to follow the spirit of the Smalltalk, but not its syntax and standards.
