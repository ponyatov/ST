# About
#ST #Budd

This is a [[Budd/Smalltalk|Smalltalk]]-ish system based on a portable bytecode interpreter that acts like a GuestOS over any generic system (mainstream OS, or can be embedded into any large software system by your selection).

#Smalltalk is for:

- fast software [[prototyping]] and experiments in systems design
- OS-like interactive system based on programming language engine
- the first language for programming learning
	- interactive and easy to use debugging tools
	- rich user interface
	- concepts and paradigms friendly for ordinary people not for computer science professors and Haskell/Lisp fans

Original Smalltalk has some notable [[drawbacks]] so its design and syntax should be rethought with modern habits, tendencies, and the feel of programming culture.
